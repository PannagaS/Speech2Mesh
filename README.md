# Speech2Mesh
Gen AI based 3D printing. 



Introducing “Speech-2-Mesh”: an approach which swiftly transforms speech into 3D printable meshes using advanced reconstruction models. By leveraging InstantMesh, we enable easy creation of printable objects without traditional CAD software. Comparative studies with Point-E (Nichol et al., 2022), Point2Mesh (Hanocka et al.,, 2020), and CAD methods underscore our efficiency and quality. This work pioneers speech-driven 3D printing, enhancing accessibility and speed while maintaining high output standards. Powered by OpenAI’s Whisper (Radford et al., 2022) and a stable diffusion model, our system generates multi-view images, which, through InstantMesh (Xu et al., 2024), produce optimized meshes for printing. Embracing state-of-the-art generative models, our pipeline democratizes 3D modeling, welcoming non-technical users into the fold.
